Description: Free open-source SQL full-text search engine
 Sphinx is generally a standalone search engine, meant to provide fast,
 size-efficient and relevant fulltext search functions to other applications.
 Sphinx was specially designed to integrate well with SQL databases and
 scripting languages.
 .
 Currently built-in data sources support fetching data
 either via direct connection to MySQL or PostgreSQL, or using XML pipe
 mechanism (a pipe to indexer in special XML-based format which Sphinx
 recognizes).
 .
 As for the name, Sphinx is an acronym which is officially decoded as SQL Phrase
 Index.
